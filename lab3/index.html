			<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
			<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file
				structure on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Getting the images to appear right in my website was pretty hard, especially for the lab 3.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Well you are looking at the index.html file I created.
				Here is the file structure that I made:</p>
			<img src="img/file-structure.png" width=650>
		</section>
		<nav id="links">
			<br></br>
			<a href="../index.html">Homepage</a>
		</nav>
	</body>
