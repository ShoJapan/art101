            <h1>Lab 2 HTML & CSS Starter</h1>

            <p>Edward Oh and Sho Serrano have both worked on Lab 2 via online. We both shared screenshots throughout the lab. We had some problems with Github updating files and such but worked through our problems. Sho Serrano had some internet problems during the evening but weas resolved in about 30 minutes. Everything went smooth sail and we had a relatively fun time figuring things out. </p>
