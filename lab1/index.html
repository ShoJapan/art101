					<h2>Explore the Modern Web</h2>
					<p>For the assignment, “Lab 1:Getting Started” I have installed all required software and
						have completed all of the tasks given to me in a cleanly formatted way. I made sure all
						sentences fitted on the same page while making sure the screenshots I provided
						accurately depict and show the features of the websites I was intrigued by.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For some
						of the websites, I had a hard time screenshotting due to the mouse track I needed to
						show and my keyboard configuration.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I have made the format of this assignment easy to understand making subtitles and headers
						while also providing accurate screenshots of websites that depict what I am describing about them.</p>
